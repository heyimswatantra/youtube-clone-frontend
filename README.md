## Code Style and Best Practices

- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use functional components and hooks in React
- Write self-documenting code and add comments for complex logic
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Optimize imports and remove unused code
- Handle errors gracefully and provide user feedback
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper prop-types for all components

For file uploads:

- Validate files on the client-side before uploading
- Implement progress indicators for uploads
- Use secure methods when interfacing with third-party services
- Handle large files efficiently, consider using chunked uploads

## Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Create integration tests for key user flows
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical functionality
- Run tests before submitting a pull request:
  ```
  npm run test
  ```

## Deployment

Our project uses [Specify your CI/CD tool] for continuous integration and deployment. Every merge to `main` triggers a deployment to our staging environment. Production deployments are manual and require approval.
